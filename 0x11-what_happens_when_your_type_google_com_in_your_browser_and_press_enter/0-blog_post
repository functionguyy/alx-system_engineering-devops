The internet (or internet) is the global system of interconnected computer
networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between
networks and devices. It is a network of networks.

The two principal namespaces on the internet, The Internet Protocol(IP) address
space and the Domain Name System(DNS) space, work together to make it easy for
we humans to use the internet efficiently. 

TCP/IP is a suite of protocols used by devices to communicate over the
internet. It is named after two of it's original
protocols - the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet
Protocol (IP)


TCP is used to send bits of data known as packets.
TCP build on top of the IP protocol. In other words, a packet is sent to an IP
address. 

## What is an IP address?

Every machine on the internet has a unique number assigned to it, called an IP
address. Without a unique IP address on your machine, you will not be able to
communicate with other devices, users, and computers on the internet. You can
look at your IP address as if it were a telephone number, each one being unique
and used to identify a way to reach you and only you.

An IP address always consists of 4 numbers separated by periods, with numbers
having a possible range of 0 through 255. An example of how an IP address
appears is: 127.0.0.1

## What is DNS?
The domain name system, or DNS, is a global system responsible for mapping
human-readable hostnames to their corresponding Internet Protocol (IP)
addresses. For example, if you want to access a website using a domain name
like example.com, that domain name must point to a valid IP address.

## Servers vs Webservers
Internet resources are stored/hosted on special computers known as Servers. 
These Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. Webservers run
applications which transfers copies of the webpages stored on a Server to other
computers requesting for it.

Recall that every machine connected to a network has a unique IP address.
Same goes for Server computers too connected the internet. That means to locate
a website, you have to know the IP address of the Server computer on which the 
files for the website is stored. But remembering numbers separated by dots is 
not something we humans find easy to do. Hence the DNS was created to hold the 
record of the human-readable names associated with each IP address connected to
the internet. This human-readable name is called `hostname`

For this article, the `hostname` we interested in is `www.google.com`

## Clients and servers
Computers connected to the internet are called client and servers. We already
talked about what is a server. Clients are the typical web user's
internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-FI,
or your phone connected to your mobile network) and web-accessing software
available on those devices (usually a web browser like MS Edge or Chrome). This
two sets of computers are able communicate with eachother using HyperText
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) (Think of it like how two people who understand
English will cnverse with English Language).


## HTTP
In the beginning, network administrators had to figure out how to share the
information thay put out on the internet.

They agreed on a procedure for exchanging information and called it Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

HTTP is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers
to speak to each other.

### HTTP vs HTTPS
All communication sent over regular HTTP connections are in _plain text_ and
can be read by any hacker that manages to break into the connection between
your browser and the Webserver.

Once everyone knew how to exchange information , intercepting on the internet
was not difficult. So knowledgeable administrators agreed upon a procedure to
protect the information exchanged on the internet. The protection relies on SSL
certificate to encrypt the online data. Encryption means that the sender and
recipient agree upon a "code" and translate their documents into random-looking
character strings.

The procedure for encrypting information and then exchanging it is called
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)
