# Loops, conditions and parsing

This file contains the highlights from my study of the implementation of the above concepts in bash scripting

# The for loop

The syntax for this loop is:

```bash

for NAME [in LIST]; do COMMANDS; done

```
`NAME` can be any variable name. `LIST` can be any
list of words, strings or numbers, which can be literal or generated by any
command. The `COMMANDS` to execute can also be any operating system commands,
script, program or shell statement.

```bash
for name in best school is alx; do
	echo $name
done
```
if `[in LIST]` is not present, it is replaced with `in $@` and `for` executes
`COMMANDS` once for each positional parameter that is set.

`$@` expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the
expansion occurs within double quotes, each parameter expands to a separate
word.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for i in "$@"; do
	echo "Parameter is $i"
done
```
Another syntax for this loop is:
```bash
for ((expr; expr; expr)); do COMMANDS; done
```
## Comparison Operators
### integer comparison

- `-eq` : is equal to `if [ "$a" -eq "$b" ]
